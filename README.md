## My process

 I have just completed my first Frontend-Mentor challenge. After being away from coding for months, this challenge was a good warm-up for me. When I started this challenge, I even couldn't recognize the HTML syntax (funny, huh!!!). However,  I still managed to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and flexbox with the help of Youtube & Google :) 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned
Through completing this program i was able to learn flexbox, CSS units.



### Useful resources

- [Flexbox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTlczfR82mQ&t=381s) - This helped me with understanding Flexbox. 
- [Flexbox interactive website](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - Flexbox can be quite confusing. Therefore, practice is essential. Using this interactive website I was able to grasp the concept of FlexBox.  It's a great resource for anyone struggling with Flexbox.
